         * What Is an Object?
         * - An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.
         * - Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.
         * What Is a Class?
         * - A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

        /**
         * Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology.
         * Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects:
         * your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.
         *
         * Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
         * - Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail).
         * - Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and
         * behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes).
         *
         * An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages)
         * and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).
